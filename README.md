# Predicting Biodegradability

A project to build predictive models that estimate the biodegradability of chemical compounds using data science and statistical methods in R.

## What It Does
- Loads and cleans chemical compound data  
- Extracts features relevant to biodegradability  
- Trains predictive models (e.g. regression or classification)  
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like balanced accuracy and AUC

## Usage

### Setup
- Clone the repository  
- Install required R packages (listed in the R scripts)  
- Place the dataset under the `data/` directory  

### Run the Analysis
Open `Project.Rmd` (R Markdown) or run `ChemsRUS_Project.R` to:
- Preprocess the data  
- Train and validate models  
- Visualize results
